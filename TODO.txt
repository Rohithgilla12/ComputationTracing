 Apart from the tasks given to us, we have :

1)We need to work on the modules for solving of linear and quadratic equations
2)We taught of using this "numpy.linalg.solve" module but didn't find enough time to re-search on it.
3)We were trying to solve the cube one and we got an eaiser idea to solve for the rectangle but due to time problem we
 weren't able to do rectangle using shorter method
4)We even tried using OOP concept but later taught that the funcional programming is more efficent in this case
5)With additional time we may able to complete the cube thing but we may show up some day saying that we have cracked the code.
6)  Plotted the path of the light ray in the cavity in a graph.
7)  Displayed appropriate error messages for every possible error and tried to make the program as interactive and easy to comprehend as possible.
8)  Given the user the freedom to select a cavity of dimensions of his/her choice.
